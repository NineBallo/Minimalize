Thank you stack overflow.

Only first arg is mandatory...

Minimalize(string, string, int, int)

./Minimalize WindowName CommandToRun SleepInMS Loops

Example's for normal usage
./minimalize spotify

you really only need the first arg maybe second I woulden't touch the other two
./minimalise spotify spotify 100 200

this will in order of args look for "spotify", start "spotify", sleep 100MS every loop, loop 200 times before erroring.
