Thank you stack overflow.

Only first arg is mandatory...

This is in no way good code, I hacked this together at 5AM because a few programs I have set to autostart would always popup everywhere and it was annoying... but it works so I mean steal a binary if you really want it.

Minimalize(string, string, int, int)

./Minimalize WindowName CommandToRun SleepInMS Loops

Example's for normal usage
./minimalize spotify

you really only need the first arg maybe second I woulden't touch the other two
./minimalise spotify spotify 100 200

this will in order of args look for "spotify", start "spotify", sleep 100MS every loop, loop 200 times before erroring.
